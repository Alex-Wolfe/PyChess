Gamerules to do:

Add castling behavior


Other to do:
implement cpu mode
possibly optimize finding of valid moves with respect to check:
	currently each time a piece is clicked, its moves are generated and then filtered by deciding what moves would put it in check
	could change so that at the beginning of each turn, all moves are calculated, clicking on pieces simply selects certain ones
	this would make it so that clicking pieces and showing moves is faster

Extras to do:
