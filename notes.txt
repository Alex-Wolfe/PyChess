Simple CPU AI explanation
a simple AI would prioritize the following moves
     1.) Putting enemy in check
     2.) Taking enemy piece (ranked by piece value in order of queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn
     3.) Castling if possible
     4.) Else, make random move
     5.) Look one move ahead to maximize expected score

Extra Rules:   if a pawn is the most valuable piece the cpu can take, make random move
               Never make a move to put the enemy in check if the position is contested by the enemy and not contested by self
               In future, only make tradeable move if trade value is net positive judged by piece value
