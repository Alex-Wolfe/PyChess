Gamerules to do:
complete


Extras to do:
flip board so that each player takes their turn from the same perspective
when deciding to defend a high value piece, either move away with or without taking an enemy piece, or
attempt to find another ally piece that can capture the threat

Simple CPU AI explanation
CPU AI will prioritize the following moves
     1.) Putting enemy in checkmate
     2.) Pawn promotion (when pawn is one move away)
     3.) Putting enemy in check (without throwing away pieces)
     4.) Taking enemy piece or defending a threatened piece (ranked by piece value in order of queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn)
     5.) Castling if possible
     6.) Else, make random move

Extra AI Explanation:   
               Never make a move to put the enemy in check if the position is contested and the trade is not positive
               Moves that put the enemy in check while also taking a more valuable enemy piece are more desirable
               Moves that put the enemy in check while also taking a more valuable enemy piece without putting the ally piece
                    in danger is highly desired
               Taking more valuable enemy pieces is desired, but taking enemy pieces without entering a contested square is slightly better
               Only overtake into a contested square if the value of the captured enemy is greater than self
               Moving a highly valued ally piece out of danger is weighed against the value of taking an enemy piece, 
                    however, moving an ally piece out of danger while also taking an enemy piece is supremely desired
               Only make random moves that do not put the ally piece in danger

Current problems:
cpu might not make move? Maybe?
game crashed when only make available to get out of check involved putting cpu queen in danger
