Simple CPU AI explanation
a simple AI would prioritize the following moves
     1.) Putting enemy in check
     2.) Taking enemy piece (ranked by piece value in order of queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn
     3.) Else, make random move
     4.) Look one move ahead to maximize expected score
Note: if a pawn is the most valuable piece the cpu can take, make random move
