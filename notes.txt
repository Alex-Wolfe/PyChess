Gamerules to do:
complete


Extras to do:
flip board so that each player takes their turn from the same perspective
add cpu defense mechanic so that it attempts to protect its high value pieces when they are in danger


Simple CPU AI explanation
a simple AI would prioritize the following moves
     1.) Putting enemy in checkmate
     2.) Putting enemy in check
     3.) Taking enemy piece (ranked by piece value in order of queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn
     4.) Castling if possible
     5.) Else, make random move

Extra AI Mechanics:   if a pawn is the most valuable piece the cpu can take, make random move
               Never make a move to put the enemy in check if the position is contested by the enemy and not contested by self
               only overtake into a contested square if the value of the captured enemy is greater than self
